									<p>                                                            I was born in Jacksonville, raised in Callahan, and then came back home to Jacksonville FL. 
                                                                        I've taken many detours in life and have become a better man for it.

                                                                        At home I can be found tinkering with a Breadboard and Arduino or working on various pet projects such as this webpage.
                                                                        Below are some snapshots of my journey up to this point. Enjoy!</p>

									<p>Two years ago I finally had my first son... with four paws and a tail. Raising Bowden from a pup taught me lessons in responsibility I never knew I needed. 
                                                                           The potty training and sleepless nights were trails that have molded me into a more responsible adult. Our favorite activities include hiking and playing fetch.
                                                                           Bowden is family and has always found ways to brighten my days. Here's to many more games of tug-of-war son. You may beat me... one day. </p>

									<p>October 12th 2018 is a day that will forever live in my memory. That day my father suddenly passed away. Jeffrey Wayne Evans wore many hats in his life from his days as a 
                                                                           Volunteer Firefighter becoming the Lieutenant of Station 8 to creating and running his own Small Business (Jeffery's Attic) while still working a full time job. His work ethic was

									<p>Travelng has been one of my most rewarding hobbies to date. Giving me a diverse perspective that can only be achieved with the attitud of "Been There, Done That."
                                                                           My favorite expedition so far has been hiking Providence Canyon in Lumpkin GA (pictured above) however in the future I plan to schedule an excursion on the West Coast.
                                                                           Traveling is a journey I've only just scratched the surface of. </p>

									<p>Music has been a part of my life since playing the Tuba in middleschool and has taken me places ever since. 
                                                                           In highschool I transitioned to Drumline and used one of my summers to participate in the DCI World Championships playing at Lucas Oil Stadium of the Indianapolis Colts. 
                                                                           Playing Tuba in college helped me pay for my Associates degree at Florida State College at Jacksonville and I even played for Jacksonville University's drumline for a short period.
                                                                           Music helped me wander. And wandering helped me experience life in ways I will forever appreciate. </p>
