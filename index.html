					<h3>Where are they now?</h3>
					<p class="quote">"Time is measured by years, wisdom is measured by mistakes, and love is measured by
						you."</p>
					<p>
						I was born and raised in the South, eventually returning to my hometown.
						I've taken many detours in life and have become a better man for it.
						You can catch me at a football game or reading a book on the beach.
						At home I can be found tinkering with a Breadboard and Arduino or working on various pet
						projects such as this webpage.
						Below are some snapshots of my journey up to this point. Enjoy!

						<h3>Bobby "Bowden"</h3>
						<p>
							Two years ago I finally had my first son... with four paws and a tail. Raising Bowden from a
							pup taught me lessons in responsibility I never knew I needed.
							The potty training and sleepless nights were trials that have molded me into a more
							responsible adult. Our favorite activities include hiking and playing fetch.
							Bowden is family and has always found ways to brighten my days. Here's to many more games of
							tug-of-war son. You may beat me... one day.

						<h3>"Mist"ified</h3>
						<p>
							My path in writing started with the passing of my father but certainly did not end there.
							Currently I am working on a short novel named "Mist" which can be read via Wattpad here.
							Only chapter one is currently available and I've put this project on hold while I pursue
							other interests but I hope to be working on it again soon!

						<h3>Expectations</h3>
						<p>
							October 12th 2018 is a day that will forever live in my memory. That day my father suddenly
							passed away. Jeffrey Wayne Evans wore many hats in his life from his days as a
							Volunteer Firefighter becoming the Lieutenant of Station 8 to creating and running his own
							Small Business (Jeffery's Attic) while still working a full time job. His work ethic was
							unquestionable and my father left huge shoes to fill. This started my path in writing as an
							outlet to understand and come to terms with our loss. My poem Expectations was written for
							my father and can be read here via Wattpad.

						<span class="date">The Road Less Traveled</span>
						<h3>Wandering With Wonder</h3>
						<p>
							Traveling has been one of my most rewarding hobbies to date. Giving me a diverse perspective
							that can only be achieved with the attitude of "Been There, Done That."
							My favorite expedition so far has been hiking Providence Canyon in Lumpkin GA (pictured
							above) however in the future I plan to schedule an excursion on the West Coast.
							Traveling is a journey I've only just scratched the surface of.

						<h3>Music On My Mind</h3>
						<p>
							Music has been a part of my life since playing the Tuba in middleschool and has taken me
							places ever since.
							In highschool I transitioned to Drumline and used one of my summers to participate in the
							DCI World Championships playing at Lucas Oil Stadium of the Indianapolis Colts.
							Playing Tuba in college helped me pay for my Associates degree and I even played for a
							University drumline for a short period.
							Music helped me wander. And wandering helped me experience life in ways I will forever
							appreciate.

						<h3>Love At First Byte?</h3>
						<p>
							During my childhood my parents gifted me a Breadboard Lab Kit and I've been fascinated by
							electronics ever since.
							From tasks as small as fixing the WiFi in my childhood home to creating a game server via
							Hamachi in my highschool years,
							my hobby stuck and has progressed into a career I've enjoyed ever since.
